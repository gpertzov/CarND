# CarND - simple car physics using ODE
## https://www.gpdev.net

#### About

CarND is a sample application which demonstrates how to implement
simple car physics using the [Open Dynamics Engine library](www.ode.org).

CarND is part of the [NeuroDriver project](https://www.gpdev.net/NeuroDriver.html)


The physics code is identical to the one running in the NeuroDriver 2 simulation.
